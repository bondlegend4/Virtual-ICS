# ICSs virtualized lab testbed for cybersecurity testing - Meeting Notes for 08/06/2023

## Minutes

- Minute created by [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander).

## Closed issues and decisions

- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) deployed simplified version of the project on GNS3 and performed some attacks successfully. [Video Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W10l6Pk4seo)
- [Santiago Figueroa](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05) and [Mikel Dean](mdeanoses@ceit.es) gave [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) feedback about the automation.py diagram-

## Open issues and questions

- Proposals of possible solutions and workarounds to the [OpenPLC-WWTP interface problem](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/ICSsVirtualForCiberSec/issues/29)
  - OpenPLC Forum
- GNS3 deployment of the whole project
  - Communication errors on the WWTP-OpenPLC interface appear sometimes, triggering socket binding errors. Might have to do witch packet loss between interface and OpenPLC.
  - [Santiago Figueroa](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05) will test the project deployment and perform troubleshooting
- Measures and attack detection methods
  -  [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will develop attack-detection table
  -  [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) wil implement attack detection algorithm described in [This Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1874548218301641) for each of the signals measured in the WWTP.
  -  [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will implement pfsense firewall on server host machine to monitorize network interfaces
  -  [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will implment wazhu on GNS3 to monitorize network metrics and detect possible attacks
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will complete ModTester automatization feature
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will fix modTester.py diagram based on received feedback
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) continued research about attack behaviour methods and measurements

## Discussion and proposals

- GNS3 deployment of whole project
  - Possible GNS3 network mapping errors
- Attack behaviour measurement and methods
  - Network-based methods: pfsense, wazhu, paper algorithm
