# ICSs virtualized lab testbed for cybersecurity testing - Meeting Notes for 03/05/2023

## Minutes
- Minute created by [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander).

## Closed issues and decisions
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) implemented ModBus WWTP-PLC interface based on [thiagoralves/OpenPLC_Simulink-Interface](https://github.com/thiagoralves/OpenPLC_Simulink-Interface) locally. [Video Demonstration](https://youtu.be/0kVg-kbwbDM)
- [Santiago Figueroa](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05) and [Mikel Dean](mdeanoses@ceit.es) gave [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) feedback about the ModTester diagram
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) mentioned problems faced when trying to access memory registers(%MD) from WWTP-PLC interface and the team disussed possible solutions and workarounds
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) proposed future ToDo list based on priority and the team discussed it

## Open issues and questions
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will try to implement a workaround to access memory registers(%MD) from WWTP-PLC interface
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will include Simulink model in Docker Matlab container
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will implement ScadaLTS-PLC interface
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will fix modTester.py diagram based on received feedback
- [Santiago Figueroa](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05) and [Mikel Dean](mdeanoses@ceit.es) will give [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) feedback about the automation.py diagram
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will study the possibility of implementing WWTP over Matlab runtime
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will verify if the [OpenPLC Editor](https://openplcproject.com/docs/3-1-openplc-editor-overview/) project supports an export format to be flashed to a physical Omron/Siemens PLC
