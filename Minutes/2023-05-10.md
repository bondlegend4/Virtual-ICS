# ICSs virtualized lab testbed for cybersecurity testing - Meeting Notes for 10/05/2023

## Minutes
- Minute created by [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander).

## Closed issues and decisions
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) implemented a workaround to access memory registers(%MD) from WWTP-PLC interface
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) included Simulink model in Docker Matlab container
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) found out that OpenPLC Editor does  not have export compatibility to Omron/Siemens PLC. The team decided to port manually the OpenPLC program to the physical PLC in the future if time permits
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) explained problems faced when trying to compile WWTP-PLC interface. The team proposed to compile the interface in Windows and include it in a container so as to be able to run it on Linux later
- The team decided to focus on having a simple but functional version of the project an then upgrade it gradually

## Open issues and questions
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will implement ScadaLTS-PLC interface
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will fix modTester.py diagram based on received feedback
- [Santiago Figueroa](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05) and [Mikel Dean](mdeanoses@ceit.es) will give [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) feedback about the automation.py diagram
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will study the possibility of implementing WWTP over Matlab runtime
    - Add Docker component “Package MATLAB Standalone Applications into Docker Images” for WWTP
    - Add Docker component “Package MATLAB Standalone Applications into Docker Images” for the OpenPL-WWTP interface


## Discussion and proposals
- WWTP-PLC interface troubleshooting and possible solutions
- Possible solutions to implement WWTP Simulink model over Matlab runtime. [Examples](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/DepSimModStandAppDocker)
- Matlab application compilation in Docker
    - Possible optimization when loading variables
    - Research how to include simulation time as argument
    - Research docker system architecture(Application/Simulink model/Submodules, API, etc.)
- Long-term purpose of the project
- Project Schedule
  - Best & worst case scenario
  - Cybersecurity part
