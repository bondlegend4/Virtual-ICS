# ICSs virtualized lab testbed for cybersecurity testing - Meeting Notes for 14/06/2023

## Minutes

- Minute created by [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander).

## Closed issues and decisions

- Measures and attack detection methods
  -  [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) developed attack-detection table
  -  [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) started to implement attack detection algorithm described in [This Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1874548218301641) for each of the signals measured in the WWTP.
  -  [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) tried to implment wazhu on GNS3 to monitorize network metrics and detect possible attacks

## Open issues and questions

- GNS3 deployment of the whole project
  - Communication errors on the WWTP-OpenPLC interface appear sometimes, triggering socket binding errors. Might have to do witch packet loss between interface and OpenPLC.
  - [Santiago Figueroa](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05) will test the project deployment and perform troubleshooting
- Measures and attack detection methods
  -  [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will finish implementing attack detection algorithm described in [This Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1874548218301641) for each of the signals measured in the WWTP.
  -  [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will finish deploying wazuh on GNS3 to monitorize network metrics and detect possible attacks
- Proposals of possible solutions and workarounds to the [OpenPLC-WWTP interface problem](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/ICSsVirtualForCiberSec/issues/29)
  - OpenPLC Forum
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will complete ModTester automatization feature
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will fix modTester.py diagram based on received feedback
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) continued research about attack behaviour methods and measurements

## Discussion and proposals

- Problem installing pfsense on GNS3 server machine
  - AWS VM does not support virtualization
  - Possible workaround: deploy project on local [VM](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/deployment-options/virtual-machine/virtual-machine.html)
- Problem installing wazhu on GNS3 project
- Algorithm implementation
  - Top priority at the moment
  - Python container running script for each of the WWTP variables

## Special notes
