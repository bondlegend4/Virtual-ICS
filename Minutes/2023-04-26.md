## Minutes
- Minute created by [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander).

## Closed issues and decisions
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) wrote Modbus WWTP-PLC interface design document.
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) proposed [thiagoralves/OpenPLC_Simulink-Interface](https://github.com/thiagoralves/OpenPLC_Simulink-Interface) as the WWTP-OpenPLC interface.
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) corrected Interface.mainloop() diagram error.
- [Santiago Figueroa](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05) and [Mikel Dean](mdeanoses@ceit.es) read State of The Art document and gave [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) feedback.
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) started studying ScadaLTS-OpenPLC interaction  to design ScadaLTS-PLC interface.

## Open issues and questions
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will implement ModBus WWTP-PLC interface based on [thiagoralves/OpenPLC_Simulink-Interface](https://github.com/thiagoralves/OpenPLC_Simulink-Interface).
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will include automation script in ModTester flux diagrams.
- [Santiago Figueroa](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05) and [Mikel Dean](mdeanoses@ceit.es) will  give [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) feedback about the ModTester diagram.
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will design ScadaLTS-PLC interface and design an interface for ScadaLTS control panel.
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will study the possibility of implementing WWTP over Matlab runtime.
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will verify if the [OpenPLC Editor](https://openplcproject.com/docs/3-1-openplc-editor-overview/) project supports an export format to be flashed to a physical Omrom/Siemens PLC.

## Discussion and proposals
- WWTP interface with PLC and ScadaLTS.
