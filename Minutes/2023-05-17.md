# ICSs virtualized lab testbed for cybersecurity testing - Meeting Notes for 17/05/2023

## Minutes
- Minute created by [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander).

## Closed issues and decisions
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) deployed simplified version of the whole project on Docker successfully
  - Containerization of interface compiler using [gcc Official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/gcc)
  - Implementation of ScadaLTS-OpenPLC interface + Graphical View
  - Communication between containers

## Open issues and questions
- Proposals of possible solutions and workarounds to the [OpenPLC-WWTP interface problem](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/ICSsVirtualForCiberSec/issues/29)
  - Possible workaround: deploy various interfaces
  - Socket communication between OpenPLC and interface
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will deploy the project on GNS3
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will complete ModTester automatization feature
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will fix modTester.py diagram based on received feedback
- [Santiago Figueroa](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05) and [Mikel Dean](mdeanoses@ceit.es) will give [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) feedback about the automation.py diagram
- Implementation of WWTP over Matlab runtime postponed for the moment
    - Add Docker component “Package MATLAB Standalone Applications into Docker Images” for WWTP
    - Add Docker component “Package MATLAB Standalone Applications into Docker Images” for the OpenPL-WWTP interface


## Discussion and proposals
- WWTP-PLC interface troubleshooting and possible solutions
  - Ask in OpenPLC forum for possible solutions to [OpenPLC-WWTP interface problem](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/ICSsVirtualForCiberSec/issues/29)
- Decision to focus on having a simple but functional version of the project instead of implmenting WWTP over Matlab runtime
  - Runtime implementation would most probably delay the project
  - Making the project work is top priority at the moment
- Physiscal PLC information meeting
  - Physical project implementation is left as a future project due to time restrictions
- Project Schedule
  - Next steps: Attack behaviour measurements
    - Research publications about measures and measurement methods

## Special notes
