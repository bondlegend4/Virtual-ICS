# ICSs virtualized lab testbed for cybersecurity testing - Meeting Notes for 31/05/2023

## Minutes

- Minute created by [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander).

## Closed issues and decisions

- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) deployed simplified version of the project on GNS3 successfully

## Open issues and questions

- Proposals of possible solutions and workarounds to the [OpenPLC-WWTP interface problem](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/ICSsVirtualForCiberSec/issues/29)
  - OpenPLC Forum
- GNS3 deployment of the whole project
  - AWS VM might not be enough to bear project with attacker
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will complete ModTester automatization feature
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) will fix modTester.py diagram based on received feedback
- [Santiago Figueroa](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05) and [Mikel Dean](mdeanoses@ceit.es) will give [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) feedback about the automation.py diagram
- [Ander Gómez](https://github.com/gomezander) continued research about attack behaviour methods and measurements

## Discussion and proposals

- WWTP-PLC interface problem
  - Try to fix the problem with community feedback
- GNS3 deployment of whole project
  - Check if AWS VM bears whole prject deployment with the attacker
- Attack behaviour measurement and methods
  - Network-based methods are most suitable in our case
