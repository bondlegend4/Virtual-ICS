- Build openplc image:
  - cd `~/ICSVirtual/openplc`
  - `docker build -t open-plc .`
  
## Use the OpenPLC image created for the project

- Open docker-compose file `cd ~/ICSVirtual/network/ICSNetwork`.
- Change the image of the `openplc` service by `sflorenz05/open-plc:v0.1`.
- The login credentials are set by default to `openplc` for both user and password.
