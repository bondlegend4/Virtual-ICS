   abstract = {With the advent of smart industry, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are increasingly using Cloud, IoT, and other services to meet Industry 4.0 targets. The connectivity inherent in these services exposes such systems to increased cybersecurity risks. To protect ICSs against cyberattacks, intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems empowered by machine learning are used to detect abnormal behavior of the systems. Operational ICSs are not safe environments to research intrusion detection systems due to the possibility of catastrophic risks. Therefore, realistic ICS testbeds enable researchers to analyze and validate their intrusion detection algorithms in a controlled environment. Although various ICS testbeds have been developed, researchers' access to a low-cost, adaptable, and customizable testbed that can accurately simulate industrial control systems and suits security research is still an important issue. In this paper, we present ICSSIM, a framework for building customized virtual ICS security testbeds, in which various types of cyber threats and attacks can be effectively and efficiently investigated. This framework contains base classes to simulate control system components and communications. ICSSIM aims to produce extendable, versatile, reproducible, low-cost, and comprehensive ICS testbeds with realistic details and high fidelity. ICSSIM is built on top of the Docker container technology, which provides realistic network emulation and runs ICS components on isolated private operating system kernels. ICSSIM reduces the time for developing ICS components and offers physical process modelling using software and hardware in the loop simulation. We demonstrated ICSSIM by creating a testbed and validating its functionality by showing how different cyberattacks can be applied.},

   abstract = {The possibility of cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure, and in particular nuclear power plants, has prompted several efforts by academia. Many of these works aim to capture the vulnerabilities of the industrial control systems used in these plants through computer simulations and hardware in the loop configurations. However, general results in this area are limited by the cost and diversity of existing commercial equipment and protocols, as well as by the inherent complexity of the nuclear plants. In this context, this work introduces a testbed for the study of cyber-attacks against a realistic simulation of a nuclear power plant. Our approach consists in surveying issues regarding realistic simulations of nuclear power plants and to design and experimentally validate a software testbed for the controlled analysis of cyberattacks against the simulated nuclear plant. The proposal integrates a simulated Modbus/TCP network environment containing basic industrial control elements implemented with open-source software components. We validate the proposed testbed architecture by performing and analyzing a representative cyberattack in the developed environment, thus showing the principles for the analysis of other possible cybernetic attacks.},

   abstract = {Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are responsible for the control of several processes in various critical infrastructure deployments ranging from energy, power and water utilities, to manufacturing sectors such as pharmaceutical precision engineering. They ensure the smooth, safe running and High Availability of these critical infrastructure and manufacturing processes. ICS cybersecurity is of increasing concern and this is evidenced by the mounting examples of cyber threats and attacks on ICS infrastructure that are referenced both within the technical community and the public media. The barriers of entry to ICS cybersecurity are still high given the limited skills base, expensive and proprietary hardware and software, as well as the inherent dangers of manipulating real physical processes. This greatly inhibits the practical application of cybersecurity tools in ICS environments and therefore the opportunity for practitioners to gain valuable experience. Furthermore, historical ICS testbeds have not delivered a practical application of accessing and improving ICS security posture as poisited in known ICS industry standards. This project seeks to build a comprehensive opensource virtualised ICS testbed to demonstrate typical cybersecurity weaknesses in an ICS environment as well as suitable remediation strategies. This testbed shall simulate real world industrial systems as closely as possible without replicating an entire plant. This research will identify a suitable ICS testbed to visualise the stages of an ICS cyber attack with reference to the ICS cyber kill chain proposed by the SysAdmin, Audit, Network and Security Institute. With the selected ICS testbed as a reference, this project shall also demonstrate an ICS cybersecurity evaluation based on the US National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework, detailing how defenders can identify vulnerable components in the ICS, identify potential threat vectors within the environment and develop suitable mitigations to improve the organisations overall security posture. This project contributes to growing ICS cybersecurity skills to better protect industrial processes and critical infrastructure.},
